# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: May 27, 2025_

At **MyInboxReport**, your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our open source app.

---

## 1. No Server Storage

We do **not** store, share, or access your data on our servers. All email data is processed either locally in your browser or, if using cloud AI models, only temporarily and never saved. If we use any APIs for processing (e.g., LLMs), the data is only temporarily passed and not retained.

## 2. Data We Access

With your explicit permission, we access:

- Your Gmail inbox via Google OAuth with **read-only** access.
- Metadata such as senders, timestamps, and subject lines for analytics.

## 3. What We Don't Do

- We do **not** save your emails or any content on our servers.
- We do **not** use your data for advertising or profiling.
- We do **not** sell your data to third parties.

## 4. Your Consent

You control access at all times through your Google account permissions. You can revoke access at any time via [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

## 5. Third-Party Services

If any third-party AI service is used (e.g., for generating reports), we'll make this transparent and ensure minimal data transfer with **no logging**.

## 6. Open Source Transparency

MyInboxReport is open source. You can review the code at any time at [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ashish-Sontakke/myinboxreport) to verify how your data is handled.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as needed. Updates will be reflected with a new "Last updated" date.
