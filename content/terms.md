## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using MyInboxReport ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

MyInboxReport is a free, open-source, client-side web application that connects to your Gmail account via Google's OAuth system to provide analytics on your email data. The Service runs entirely in your browser. We do not operate backend servers that process your data.

## 3. Google Account Access

To use the Service, you must authorize read-only access to your Gmail account via Google Identity Services. By doing so:

- You represent that you have the authority to grant this access.
- You understand the Service will read your email messages locally in your browser.
- You can revoke access at any time via your [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

## 4. User Responsibilities

You agree to:

- Use the Service only for lawful purposes.
- Not attempt to reverse-engineer, exploit, or misuse the Service.
- Keep your API keys (if using cloud AI providers) secure and not share them.
- Comply with Google's [API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy) when using data obtained through the Service.

## 5. Third-Party AI Providers

The Service allows you to optionally configure third-party AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local Ollama) for email parsing. If you choose to use a cloud-based provider:

- You are responsible for providing your own API key and for any costs incurred.
- Your email data will be sent directly from your browser to the provider. We are not a party to this communication.
- You are subject to that provider's terms of service and privacy policy.

## 6. Data and Privacy

Your data is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted to us. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for full details on how your data is handled.

## 7. No Warranty

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that:

- The Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.
- AI-generated classifications or extractions will be accurate.
- The Service will meet your specific requirements.

You should not rely on AI-generated financial data for tax, accounting, or legal purposes without independent verification.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, MyInboxReport and its contributors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or revenue, whether incurred directly or indirectly, arising from your use of the Service.

## 9. Open Source License

The source code for MyInboxReport is available under an open source license on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ashish-Sontakke/myinboxreport). Your use of the source code is governed by the applicable open source license in the repository.

## 10. Changes to Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## 11. Contact
